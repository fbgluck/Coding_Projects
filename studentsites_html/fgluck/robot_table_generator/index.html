<h1>Robot Table Generator</h1>
<p>The APCSP test has a number of problems that test your ability and understanding
    of algorithms. Many of these problems present a grid with a robot at a starting position
    followed by an algorithm in APCS Block Language.</p>
<p>These problems ask you to follow the instructions in the algorithm to determine the 
    final position of the robot.
</p>    
<p>This program will generate a "n-by-n" grid and place a robot in an initial position.
    You can take a screen shot of the final diagram to use in other documents.
