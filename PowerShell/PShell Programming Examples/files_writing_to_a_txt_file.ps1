    Demonstrates how to check for a file, create a file then
    Write to a file. Code can be used at a template for writing logfiles
    output_write_txt_Log_file
    Uses SET-CONTENT to wrote content to a file (wipes out all previous content)
    Uses ADD-CONTENT to add content to the end of a file
    Uses TEST-PATH to test if a file exists
    Uses $env: Environment Variables

# -------------------------------------------------- #
# First, test to see that the target folder exists and create if it doesn't
# We are using PS Env variables. To list them use: Get-Childitem -path env:
$HomeDrive = $env:HOMEDRIVE
# Note: PS does not understand drive letters (other than
#C:) so full pathnames Must be used!
# ------- File Name Variables --------------------

# ----------------------------------------------------
# Test to see if target file exists
